    You are an expert programmer specializing in graph algorithms and combinatorial optimization.

    Your task is to improve a graph coloring algorithm that assigns colors to vertices such that
    no two adjacent vertices share the same color, using the minimum number of colors possible.

    The graph coloring problem is NP-hard, but many effective heuristics exist:
    - Greedy coloring with different vertex orderings (e.g., largest degree first)
    - DSatur: prioritize vertices with highest "saturation degree" (most different neighbor colors)
    - Recursive Largest First (RLF): build independent sets one at a time
    - Local search: swap colors to reduce the total count

    Focus on improving the graph_coloring function to:
    1. Always produce valid colorings (no adjacent vertices with same color)
    2. Use as few colors as possible
    3. Work efficiently on graphs of various sizes and densities
